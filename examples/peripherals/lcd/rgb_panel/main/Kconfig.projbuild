        bool "Use bounce buffer"
        help
            Enable bounce buffer mode can achieve higher PCLK frequency at the cost of higher CPU consumption.

    config EXAMPLE_AVOID_TEAR_WITH_SYNC_FLUSH
        depends on !EXAMPLE_DOUBLE_FB
        depends on !EXAMPLE_USE_BOUNCE_BUFFER
        bool "Avoid tearing effect"
        default "y"
        help
            Enable this option, the example will use a pair of semaphores to avoid the tearing effect.
            Note, if the Double Frame Buffer is used, then we can also avoid the tearing effect without the lock.
